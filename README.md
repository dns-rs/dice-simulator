# dice-simulator
A companion for tabletop gamers that can simulate up to 42 six-sided dice rolls at a time.

Goes one step beyond a standard number generator, because it simulates the spinning of the die.
During a roll, a random number of spins gets generated than it choses the value of the last spin.
